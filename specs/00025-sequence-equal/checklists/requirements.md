# Specification Quality Checklist: Ordered Sequence Equality Assertion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
- FR-001 and FR-002 name the assertion method (`Equal`) and its signatures; this is intentional because the method name is the core deliverable of a library feature, not an implementation detail.
- Out-of-scope boundaries (multi-index aggregation, deep structural equality) are explicitly called out in FR-013 and FR-014 to prevent scope creep.
